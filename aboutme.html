                <p>Hello! My name is Ally Wu and I am a junior in Cornell University studying Information Science.</p>

    		    <p>Over this past summer, I was able to study abroad in South Korea in Hanyang University, also known as 한양대학교 (han-yahng-dae-hak-gyu). This page will be dedicated to all the things I got to experience while I was abroad and my experience at an international school.Because it hasn't been long since I got back to the states, I would like to document and write down all the things I did in case I were to forget one day.<p>
